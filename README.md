## Motivation
Often, it is difficult for students to study their notes in an effective manner due to disorganization and lack of ability to optimize their study time and their position on the "forgetting curve". This problem is exacerbated in quarantine for online classes, where there is an overall lack of structure in students' days. Notention aims to improve this situation by providing students with a resource that allows them to optimize their study routine by automatically generating a study schedule based on scientific models for each note they take.
